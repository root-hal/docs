## Base URL

The Loor API is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

All request contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.loor.ai
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with contents of the header being `Bearer re_xxxxxxxxx` where `re_xxxxxxxxx` is your API Key.

```
Authorization: Bearer re_xxxxxxxxx
```

## Response codes

Resend uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| **Status** | **Description**                         |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `200`      | Successful request.                     |
| `400`      | Check that the parameters were correct. |
| `401`      | The API key used was missing.           |
| `403`      | The API key used was invalid.           |
| `404`      | The resource was not found.             |
| `429`      | The rate limit was exceeded.            |
| `5xx`      | Indicates an error with Resend servers. |

## Rate limit

The default maximum rate limit is **2 requests per second**. This number can be increased for trusted senders by request. After that, youâ€™ll hit the rate limit and receive a `429` response error code.
