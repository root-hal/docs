The response headers describe your current rate limit following every request in conformance with the **sixth IETF standard draft**:

| **Header name**       | **Description**                                                     |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ratelimit-limit`     | Maximum number of requests allowed within a window.                 |
| `ratelimit-remaining` | How many requests you have left within the current window.          |
| `ratelimit-reset`     | How many seconds until the limits are reset.                        |
| `retry-after`         | How many seconds you should wait before making a follow-up request. |

The default maximum rate limit is **2 requests per second**. This number can be increased for trusted senders upon request.

After that, youâ€™ll hit the rate limit and receive a `429` response error code. You can find all 429 responses by filtering for 429 at the **Resend Logs page**.

To prevent this, we recommend reducing the rate at which you request the API. This can be done by introducing a queue mechanism or reducing the number of concurrent requests per second. If you have specific requirements, **contact support** to request a rate increase.
